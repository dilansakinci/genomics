# genomics 
Hi! This repository includes my practices and codes along the course 
"algorithms for DNA sequencing" from coursera, given by Johns Hopkins University

I tried to write descriptions and step-by-step explanations in each practice. 
I hope it will help you along your journey :)

You can e-mail me or contact via twitter, see ya! :)
